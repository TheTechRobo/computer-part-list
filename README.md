# Opening

# TODO
Please remind me in the Issues section to update tghis

Zip up everything except this README.md file (NOT with gzip, it has to be standard), and rename it to `something.xlsx`.

Then, you should be able to open it.

# Contributing
Make sure you unzip the file (rename the extension to .zip and then decompress), and delete the original spreadsheet. The unzipped files should NOT be inside a specific folder - everything should be inside the root.

# Credits
Thanks to @TheRuntingMuumuu for helping me make this! :D
